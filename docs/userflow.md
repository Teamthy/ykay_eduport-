Ykay College EduPortal — Full User Flow Documentation



 HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT

This document has been optimized around the current implementation reality of the project. Some journeys are already visible in the frontend, some are partially implemented, and others remain planned for the next phase of development.

Status legend:
- Implemented: visible in the current frontend and working at a demo or UI level.
- Partially implemented: the journey exists in the app, but data handling, backend integration, or business logic is incomplete.
- Planned / missing: the flow is part of the product vision but is not yet built in the current codebase.

Current implementation snapshot:
- Public website browsing is implemented at a strong UI level.
- Admissions submission and status lookup are partially implemented.
- Demo login and role-based portal dashboards are implemented at a demo level.
- Full staff/student/parent operational workflows, real authentication, and database-backed actions are still missing or incomplete.
