/**
 * Mobile push delivery.
 *
 * Push was a dead end before this: the app registered device tokens at
 * /api/push/register and lib/push.ts could send to them, but `sendPush` had
 * ZERO callers. Tokens accumulated in the database and not one notification
 * was ever delivered — the app was a portal you had to remember to open, not
 * something that tells a parent their child was marked absent.
 *
 * Delivery is now hooked into createInAppNotification(), so every existing and
 * future in-app alert pushes automatically and the two cannot drift apart.
 * These tests pin that wiring, and the fire-and-forget contract that keeps a
 * push failure from breaking the thing that triggered it.
