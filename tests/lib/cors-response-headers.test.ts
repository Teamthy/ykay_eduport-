/**
 * REGRESSION: "Failed to fetch" when logging in from the Expo web build.
 *
 * The bug was NOT in lib/cors.ts, and it was NOT in the middleware — both were
 * correct, which is exactly why drops 42 and 43 failed to fix it. It was a
 * SECOND, static CORS header block in next.config.ts:
 *
 *     source: "/api/:path*",
 *     headers: [{ key: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
 *                 value: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || "*" }, ...]
 *
 * `headers()` is evaluated at BUILD time and never sees the request, so it
 * cannot echo the caller's origin. The result, verified live against the
 * deployment:
 *
 *     OPTIONS /api/auth/login  Origin: http://localhost:8081
 *       -> access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:8081     (middleware)
 *     POST    /api/auth/login  Origin: http://localhost:8081
 *       -> access-control-allow-origin: https://ykaycollege.edu.ng (next.config)
 *
 * The preflight passes, the real response is rejected, and the browser reports
 * a bare "TypeError: Failed to fetch" with no line number.
 *
 * These tests pin the invariant that fixes it: CORS is resolved per-request in
 * exactly ONE place. A static Access-Control-Allow-Origin in next.config.ts
 * silently wins over the middleware, so its mere presence is the failure.
