/**
 * Authenticated browser E2E.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Every existing test mocks Prisma via tests/setup.ts, so nothing exercised a
 * real request through real middleware against a real database. Two bugs
 * shipped straight through a green suite because of that gap:
 *
 *   - `camera=()` in next.config.ts silently disabled the QR scanner. The
 *     failure was a response header, which no unit test reads.
 *   - lib/session.ts lost the `checkRole` export. 633 tests passed; the build
 *     died. Nothing under tests/ imports checkRole, so only a real route did.
 *
 * These run against a built app and a seeded database. They are slower than
 * unit tests on purpose — they are the only thing here that proves a user can
 * actually sign in and do their job.
 *
 * Local:  npm run test:e2e:ui
 * CI:     npm run test:e2e:browser
