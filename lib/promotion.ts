/**
 * End-of-session promotion.
 *
 * This is the single most destructive operation in the product: it moves every
 * student at once, and before StudentEnrolment existed it would have silently
 * overwritten the record of where they had been.
 *
 * Two deliberate safeguards:
 *
 *  1. It is a PROPOSAL then a COMMIT, not one button. buildPlan() returns what
 *     would happen so an admin can review and override individuals; commit()
 *     only acts on the decisions handed back to it.
 *  2. commit() runs in a single transaction. A failure halfway through would
 *     otherwise leave half a school promoted and half not, with no way to tell
 *     which without reading every record.
