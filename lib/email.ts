/**
 * Sent when an applicant is enrolled and a parent portal account is created.
 *
 * Without this the temporary password appeared once in a toast on the admin
 * screen and nowhere else — if the clerk closed the tab or looked away, the
 * family had no way in short of a manual password reset. At term start, with
 * dozens of enrolments a day, that is a guaranteed queue at the front desk.
 *
 * Deliberately fire-and-forget at the call site: a mail failure must never roll
 * back a completed enrolment. The password is still returned in the API
 * response so staff can read it out if the parent's email bounces.
