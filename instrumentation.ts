/**
 * Next.js instrumentation hook — runs once, before the server handles any
 * request.
 *
 * Two jobs: validate the environment, and start error tracking.
 *
 * ── Why everything here is wrapped in try/catch ────────────────────────────
 * Next.js treats a throw from register() as fatal: the server does not start
 * and EVERY route returns 500. That is the right response to a genuinely
 * unservable config (no database, no signing secret) and a catastrophic
 * over-reaction to anything else.
 *
 * This was not hypothetical. An earlier version of lib/env.ts listed
 * RESEND_API_KEY as production-required, so the first production start
 * without an email key took the whole site down — caught only because an
 * end-to-end run booted a real production server.
 *
 * assertEnv() now throws only for genuinely fatal settings, and the catch is
 * the second layer: a mistake in the validation rules, or in the monitoring
 * SDK, must surface as a very loud log rather than an outage. Monitoring that
 * can take the site down is worse than no monitoring.
