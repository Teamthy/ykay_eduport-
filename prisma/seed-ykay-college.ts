/**
 * YKAY College — real onboarding seed.
 *
 * Seeds the school's ACTUAL academic structure from the onboarding data form:
 *   - School profile (name, motto, contact)
 *   - Classes JSS1–JSS3 and SS1–SS3
 *   - The full JSS (BECE) and SS (WAEC/IGCSE) subject lists
 *   - The Head of School account
 *   - The current academic session + terms
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT seed demo students, parents, teachers, fees,
 * gradebook structure or report cards. Those come from real records, not a
 * script. For a throwaway demo environment use `npm run db:seed` instead.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   HO_PASSWORD="<12+ chars>" npm run db:seed-ykay
 *
 * The Head of School is created with mustChangePassword = true, so the seeded
 * password is only ever a first-login credential.
 *
 * Idempotent: safe to re-run. Subjects, classes and the session are upserted.
