/**
 * Shape of a legitimate tenant id (cuid, uuid, or a slug-ish seed id).

 * The value is passed to Postgres as a bind parameter, so this is not the
 * injection defence — it is a correctness guard. Its real job is to reject a
 * blank/garbage id, because an empty context is interpreted by the RLS policy
 * as "no tenant selected", which silently turns isolation OFF rather than on.
 * Must start and end alphanumeric, so `--`-style trailing junk is refused too.

/**
 * Run database operations with Postgres Row-Level Security enforcement.
 *
 * Sets `app.current_school_id` for the duration of a transaction so the RLS
 * policies restrict every statement to that school — a DB-level guarantee that
 * one school can never read or write another's rows, even if the application
 * has a bug in a WHERE clause.
 *
 * Usage (opt-in — routes that don't use this still work, just without the
 * DB-level isolation):
 *
 *   const students = await withSchool(user.schoolId, (tx) =>
 *     tx.studentProfile.findMany({ where: { isActive: true } })
 *   );
 *
 * Multiple queries in one call share the same transaction + RLS context:
 *
 *   const [students, invoices] = await withSchool(user.schoolId, async (tx) => {
 *     return Promise.all([
 *       tx.studentProfile.count({ where: { isActive: true } }),
 *       tx.feeInvoice.count({ where: { status: "UNPAID" } }),
 *     ]);
 *   });
 *
 * ── Implementation notes (both learned the hard way against real Postgres) ──
 *
 * 1. We use `set_config(name, value, is_local => true)` rather than
 *    `SET LOCAL app.current_school_id = ${schoolId}`. `SET LOCAL` is utility
 *    syntax and cannot take a bind parameter — the tagged-template form
 *    compiles to `SET LOCAL ... = $1` and Postgres rejects it outright with
 *    `42601: syntax error at or near "$1"`. `set_config()` is an ordinary
 *    function call, so the value binds safely and the id is never interpolated
 *    into SQL text.
 *
 * 2. `is_local => true` scopes the setting to the surrounding transaction, so
 *    it is rolled back before the pooled connection is handed to another
 *    request. Note that Postgres resets it to the EMPTY STRING (not NULL) after
 *    commit — the RLS policy compensates with NULLIF(...,''), see migration
 *    20260802000000_eduos_rls_empty_context_fix. Without that, any connection
 *    that had once run withSchool() would silently return zero rows for every
 *    later unscoped query.
