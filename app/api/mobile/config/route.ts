 * Ykay is distributing the Android app as a **sideloaded APK**, not through
 * the Play Store. That removes the safety net a store provides:
 *
 *   - nothing nags a stale install to update
 *   - an APK forwarded on WhatsApp can be installed months later
 *   - OTA updates only replace JavaScript, so a build whose NATIVE layer is
 *     too old cannot be fixed over the air at all
 *
 * So the server has to be able to say "that build is too old, download a new
 * APK". Without this, an old install just starts failing in confusing ways
 * against an API that has moved on.
 *
 * Deliberately unauthenticated: a client that is too old to sign in still
 * needs to be told why.
