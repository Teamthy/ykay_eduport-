/**
 * Fonts are self-hosted, not fetched from Google at build time.
 *
 * `next/font/google` downloads the font files during `next build`. That makes
 * every build depend on reaching fonts.googleapis.com, and when the network
 * hiccups the build does not degrade — it FAILS:
 *
 *   next/font: error: Failed to fetch `Anton` from Google Fonts.
 *   > Build error occurred
 *
 * That happened on a real machine on a Nigerian connection, and it would
 * happen just as easily in CI or on a Vercel build. A school's deploy should
 * not be able to fail because a font CDN was briefly unreachable.
 *
 * These are the same files Google serves for the `latin` subset, committed to
 * the repo (55 KB total). Self-hosting also removes a third-party request from
 * every page load, which is faster on mobile data and avoids sending visitor
 * IPs to Google — worth having for a site used by children's parents.
 *
 * To update: fetch the woff2 URLs from the Google CSS and replace the files.
