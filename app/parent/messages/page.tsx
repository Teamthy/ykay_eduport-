/**
 * Parent messages.
 *
 * This page used to read `/api/parent/messages`, which returns
 * `userNotification` rows — one-way system notices, every one of them labelled
 * `from: "School"`, with no reply path and no thread. A parent could see that
 * fees were due but could not answer a question their child's teacher asked.
 *
 * It now uses the real threaded system that was already built and, until now,
 * used by exactly one screen. Parents can start a conversation about their own
 * children (`reachableStudentIds` resolves a parent to their linked students)
 * and reply to anything a teacher or the office opens.
