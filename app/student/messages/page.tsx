/**
 * Student messages.
 *
 * Students had no messaging at all: `reachableStudentIds()` returned an empty
 * array for the STUDENT role, so even if a page had existed the inbox would
 * have been blank. The library now resolves a student to their OWN profile
 * only — never their class — so they see conversations about themselves and
 * nothing about a classmate.
 *
 * `canCompose` is false. A student replying to their form teacher is the
 * intended flow; letting them open brand-new threads about themselves at will
 * is a moderation problem nobody has asked for yet, and it is far easier to
 * turn on later than to claw back.
