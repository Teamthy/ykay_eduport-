/**
 * Schema-drift guard.
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npm run check:drift
 *
 * Fails if `prisma/schema.prisma` and the migration history have diverged —
 * i.e. if a database built purely from `prisma migrate deploy` would NOT match
 * the schema the application code is generated against.
 *
 * Why this exists: the repo accumulated 25 drift items before anyone noticed,
 * and two of them were live bugs rather than cosmetic —
 *
 *   • DeviceToken was declared in schema.prisma and used by
 *     app/api/push/register/route.ts, but created by no migration. Mobile push
 *     registration failed with P2021 on every migration-built environment
 *     (fresh dev machine, CI, Vercel preview, rebuilt production).
 *   • StudentProfile.photoUrl was missing the same way, breaking the student
 *     photo upload and ID-card page.
 *
 * Both were invisible locally because those databases had been patched by hand
 * or by `prisma db push`. Only a from-scratch build reveals it — which is
 * exactly what this script does in CI.
 *
 * Exits non-zero on drift so it can gate a merge or deploy.
