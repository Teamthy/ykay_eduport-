/**
 * Term/session label reconciliation — REPORT ONLY.
 *
 * Before drop 10, four models took their term and session from the calendar or
 * from a form field rather than from AcademicSession/Term. On 2026-08-02 the
 * three sources disagreed three ways, so rows written then can be filed under
 * a label that matches nothing else.
 *
 * THIS SCRIPT WRITES NOTHING. It compares every denormalised label against the
 * school's real sessions and terms and prints what it finds. Deciding what to
 * do about a mismatch needs a human who knows which term the data actually
 * belongs to — a script cannot know whether "Third Term" written in August
 * meant last session's third term or this session's first.
 *
 *   npm run reconcile:labels
 *
 * Exit code is 0 whether or not mismatches are found: this is a report, not a
 * gate. Use --json for machine-readable output.
